# Roadmap

Mirrors the phased plan from the master build prompt (§34). Work proceeds
in small, independently verifiable increments — analyse → plan →
implement → test → validate → commit.

- [x] **Phase 0 — Foundation**: monorepo (pnpm + Turborepo), Next.js,
      TypeScript, lint, tests, CI.
- [x] **Phase 1 — Timeline**: `HistoricalEvent` model, seed data, homepage
      timeline UI, era selection.
- [x] **Phase 2 — Era Engine**: `EraManifest` model, loader/registry,
      routing (`/era/[eraId]/loading`, `/era/[eraId]/desktop`).
- [x] **Phase 3 — Desktop 1998**: boot experience, real desktop, Window
      Manager, Application Runtime (`packages/window-manager`,
      `packages/desktop-engine`, `packages/apps-runtime`); draggable /
      resizable / minimizable / maximizable windows, taskbar + start menu,
      era clock, virtual disk, and the 1998 apps (browser shell, file
      manager, notepad, terminal, mail).
- [x] **Phase 4 — Browser**: `packages/browser-engine` — URL normalisation,
      six-step `resolveHistoricalUrl` (reconstruction → snapshot → allow-listed
      archive → document → card → temporal 404), rights gating, pure history;
      Time Browser renders declarative reconstructions (AltaVista, Yahoo!,
      Google beta, GeoCities, info.cern.ch) and temporal 404s with the
      explaining event.
- [x] **Phase 5 — Time Web**: 14 documented sites, 12 original
      reconstructions (1998: AltaVista, Yahoo!, Google, GeoCities + a
      personal page, Hotmail, Excite, info.cern.ch; 2005: Google, Wikipédia,
      YouTube), temporal routing, 2005 virtual disk and favourites.
- [x] **Phase 6 — Time Search**: `packages/search-engine` — inverted index
      derived from the catalogue, +/-/"phrase" syntax, explainable ranking,
      hard temporal filter, per-era providers; results rendered inside the
      reconstructed search pages and navigable through the engine.
- [x] **Phase 7 — 1985 / Minitel**: `packages/minitel-engine` (40×25
      videotex layout, session state machine, nine function keys, data-driven
      kiosks/services/pages/datasets, latency as data, temporal filter),
      fictional services (3611 annuaire, 3614 BAL, 3615 DEMO/TEMPS/FUTUR),
      full-screen Minitel replacing the generic desktop via the theme's
      `shell: "terminal"`.
- [ ] **Phase 8 — 2005**: theme, messenger, video experience, browser.
- [ ] **Phase 9 — Admin**: events/sources/assets CRUD, rights review queue.
- [ ] **Phase 10 — Polish**: animations, audio, analytics, accessibility,
      performance.

## Recommended next step

Phase 8 — 2005: messenger (contacts, presence, a scripted conversation
driven by data) and media player (the video experience around
`first-youtube-video`), both as windowed apps on the 2005 desktop whose
disk, browser and search are already in place.

Known gaps carried forward:

- Minitel: no graphic (mosaic) characters and no double-height text; the
  screen is text-only. Sound (modem handshake) is Phase 10.

- Reconstructions cover home + search pages (plus one personal page);
  other in-site links land on the home page or a `page-unknown` 404.
- No screenshot/document snapshots yet (step 2 of the resolution flow is
  exercised by unit tests only).
- The search index is rebuilt from the catalogue at load time; a
  persisted index (Supabase, Phase 9+) is not needed at this scale.

- 1985 renders the generic desktop at 320×240 with a Minitel placeholder;
  Phase 7 replaces it with the videotex UI.
- 2005 uses the `silver-flatscreen-2005` theme tokens but `messenger` and
  `media-player` are placeholders until Phase 8.
- The virtual disk is read-only (notepad edits are not persisted).
